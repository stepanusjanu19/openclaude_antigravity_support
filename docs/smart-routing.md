# Smart auto-routing

Smart routing is an opt-in mode that classifies each user turn as **simple** or **strong** and sends it to your configured **simple** or **strong** model accordingly, so trivial turns ("ok", "rename this", "what does this do?") can go to a cheaper model while the strong model handles everything non-trivial. Whether the simple role is actually cheaper depends on how your provider bills it. OpenClaude routes to the role you set and does not verify your provider's pricing.

It is **off by default** and **experimental** — the classifier is a fast heuristic (prompt length, code blocks, reasoning/planning keywords, first turn of a session), not a perfect judge. When in doubt it routes to the strong model, so the failure mode is "no savings on a turn that could have been cheap," never a silently degraded answer on a turn you cared about.

Smart routing is provider-agnostic: it swaps the model within your current provider. It works against any backend where you have both a cheaper and a stronger model configured. It does not read your provider's, gateway's, or account's pricing, so any savings or cost estimates it shows are based on a first-party reference table and may not match what you are actually billed.

## Setup

Both roles point at `agentModels` keys (or bare model ids). For example, in `~/.openclaude.json`:

```json
{
  "agentModels": {
    "mini": { "model": "gpt-5-mini" },
    "main": { "model": "gpt-5" }
  },
  "smartRouting": {
    "enabled": true,
    "simpleModel": "mini",
    "strongModel": "main"
  }
}
```

Optional tuning fields: `simpleMaxChars` and `simpleMaxWords` raise or lower the size threshold for "simple".

## The `/smartroute` command

| Command | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `/smartroute` | Show status (enabled/disabled, the two roles, available `agentModels` keys). |
| `/smartroute on` | Enable (requires both roles set). |
| `/smartroute off` | Disable. |
| `/smartroute simple <key>` | Set the simple-turn model to an `agentModels` key. |
| `/smartroute strong <key>` | Set the strong-turn model. |

When you set roles, the command warns if the simple model is not actually priced below the strong model (for models with known first-party pricing).

## Environment variables

These set a startup default. An explicit `smartRouting` block in settings always overrides them.

| Variable | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `OPENCLAUDE_SMART_ROUTING` | `1` or `true` enables routing at startup. |
| `OPENCLAUDE_SMART_ROUTING_SIMPLE` | `agentModels` key or model id for simple turns. |
| `OPENCLAUDE_SMART_ROUTING_STRONG` | `agentModels` key or model id for strong turns. |

## Behavior notes

- **One decision per turn.** The model is chosen once when your message arrives and held for the whole turn (including its tool calls), so it does not flap mid-turn.
- **Fallback.** If a simple-routed turn's model call errors (transport or server error), it retries once on the strong model. Aborts and auth/permission/bad-request errors are not retried.
- **Allowlist.** Any model smart routing selects is checked against your org model allowlist (`availableModels`). A disallowed model is coerced to strong; if strong is also disallowed, routing disables itself for the session and the default model is used. Running `/smartroute on` re-enables routing and clears that session disable.
- **Same-provider only.** Roles must be model-only `agentModels` entries (or bare model ids). If a role resolves to a cross-provider entry (one with `base_url`/`api_key`), routing silently disables — cross-provider routing is not supported yet.
- **Auditing.** `/cost` shows a routing summary: how many turns went simple vs strong, how many escalated to strong via fallback, and an estimated savings line when both models appear in the first-party reference pricing table. That estimate is reference pricing only and may not reflect what your provider/gateway/account actually bills.
